## SBM BOILERPLATE

Tired of doing this from scratch with each project? Yes. Me too. 

### Quick Start

Clone this repo, then `rm -rf .git`, init a new git repo, and start your project. 
With such convenient shorthand predefined as:
- `make build`
- `make watch`
- `make check`

What is included?
- webpack for compiling
- eslint for linting (with SBM's current linting standards)
- babel for transpiling (with SBM's current ES6 standards)
- mocha for testing

Is wired to go.
